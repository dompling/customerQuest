## What is Loverquest?  
Loverquest is a digital board game with an intimate theme, designed to help couples explore their sexuality in a fun and engaging way.  

Each game starts by selecting a deck of cards, called a **deck**, which contains different types of challenges, known as **quests**. These can be completed alone or with your partner, with the goal of discovering new experiences and making your relationship more intriguing and stimulating.  

## Why play Loverquest?  
Loverquest allows you to experiment with new experiences and rekindle intimacy in a fun, customizable, and discreet way.  

One of its key strengths is its high level of customization: you can choose from preset decks or create your own personalized decks, tailoring them to your tastes and desires. This way, every game becomes a unique experience designed just for you and your partner.  

Additionally, Loverquest respects your privacy: it does not collect personal data, does not access the Internet, and does not display ads. For us, intimacy is a serious matter, which is why we are committed to ensuring **maximum privacy**.

## Game Modes  
There are two game modes:  
- **In-person play:** Partners play together physically. After completing an action, the turn passes to the other player.  
- **Online play:** Partners play separately using their preferred chat or video call app.* Each player browses their own quests independently, taking turns with their partner.  
  *(Loverquest assumes no responsibility for any illegal activities committed online, such as the non-consensual distribution of intimate material, the sharing of child exploitation content, or other violations of the law.)*  

## Couple Types  
At Loverquest, we believe that love belongs to everyone. To ensure an inclusive and conscious experience, couples are classified **solely based on genitalia**, allowing users to select the deck that best suits their needs. The available categories are:  
- **Heterosexual couple:** A couple where the partners have different genitalia.  
- **Lesbian couple:** A couple where both partners have female genitalia.  
- **Gay couple:** A couple where both partners have male genitalia.
